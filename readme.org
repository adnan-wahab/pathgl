The goal of this project is to allow visualizations of large
networks in the browser. 

We implement query processing on the gpu, to allow users to interact
with graphs far larger than before. This allows to see structure and 
substructure of the graph in realtime, for hundreds of thousands of edges.

Previous javascript based graph visualization libraries do not support this,
and are not dynamic at scale.

By computing dynamic position and layout on the cpu, you must
choose between realtime response times, and 

This system is designed specifically for longitudinal networks, and sparse
matrices. Both of these data structures do not play well with conventional 
analytics techniques. Visualization can help analysts understand these data
structures better.
